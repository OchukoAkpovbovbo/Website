This painting is called SOLITARY STRENGTH by Toni Grote.
  </p>

  <p>
    Toni Grote is an artist from Iowa who has sold her artwork on Etsy since 2001. "Art in Honor of Faith, Hope, and Dreams. Inspired by Light and Created with Love" is Toni's artistic code. </p>

    <p>
      I constructed Solitary Strength using basic shapes and colors, as my interpretation of her works is simple yet rich.
